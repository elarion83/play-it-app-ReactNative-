# play-it-app

The ReactNative App loading a Webview Component of play-it.fr (My own webapp based on ReactJs).

Everything build before AI. I should've wait few months lol.

Anyway this is enough to build an apk file, and install it on an Android, really proud of this workaround after spending so much time on ReactJS, which I thought was the React solution to build apk with.

Iphone user ? Ooooh you a bad boy, but anyway I'm proud to tell you that the url version (play-it.fr) is enough by itself. Youtube should let you play music even with your screen turned off.
